# Sunroof vs Moonroof

We have seen many mentioning sunroof and moonroof for the glass panel in the roof of the modern as well as some old car models. `What is the difference between a moonroof vs. a sunroof`

A sunroof was a term originally used to describe a metal panel that you could pop-up and remove or slide back. A moonroof is a term used to describe a see-through glass panel that could be opened by pushing a button.

The two terms are now used interchangeably. The big difference between the words sunroof and moonroof for most people now is the question about whether they slide open electrically. Technically the terms refer to the same thing.

The first sunroof was offered on a 1937 model Nash, a car company that was based in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The metal panel could be opened and slid back to let the sun and fresh air in. Nash built cars from 1916 till 1954.
