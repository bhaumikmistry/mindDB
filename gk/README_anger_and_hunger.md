# Anger and Hunger
## Anger
Anger is a healthy emotion, and one that we then to feel, to one degree or another, on a daily basis. When someone is angry there are actual physical and mental changes taking places in your body. The occasional bout of anger is perfectly healthy. But if it's particularly intense, or you're perpetually upset, it can be detrimental. The effects on the body are very similar to those for people experiencing anxiety over the long-term. When the anger persists longer than that, these changes start to affect your all organs, digestion, sleep, mood, and the list goes on and on.

Anger is often responsible for letting us know when our boundaries have been crossed, when our values are at risk, or when we are not being true to ourselves. 

There are so many changes going on when we are angry that we literally become a different person - if only temporarily - if we are angry enough. Your heart rate will increase and your blood will start pumping to your head.

We reflexively position ourselves for battle for clenching fists, jaws, tightening our abdomen and core. We start seeing the world through a filter of anger and we may have a very difficult time actually understanding, hearing and interpreting other people. We become single focused and single purpose.

Among other effects, the body decides that it is simply not the time for digestion, and thus slows the process down.

Elevated [cortisol](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-cortisol#1) kills neurons in the [hippocampus](https://www.britannica.com/science/hippocampus), which is where we create memories. This disrupts the creation of new memories and suppresses activity in the [hippocampus](https://www.britannica.com/science/hippocampus), which weakens short0term memory. It also prevents you from forming new memories properly. That's why highly stressful situation are harder to remember.

Anger affects your immune system, the more stressed out and anger you are the more likely you are to get sick.
