### [The Aeronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aeronauts_(film))
The Aeronauts, released in 2019, includes a fictionalized account of the 5 September 1862 flight. The film depicts fictional pilot Amelia Wren, a composite of real-life female balloonists, joining Glaisher in an epic fight for survival while attempting to make discoveries in a gas balloon. The movie omits Henry Coxwell entirely. A report in The Daily Telegraph quotes Keith Moore, Head of Library at the Royal Society (Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge), as saying: "It’s a great shame that Henry isn’t portrayed because he performed very well and saved the life of a leading scientist".
